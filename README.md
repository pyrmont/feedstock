# Feedstock

Feedstock is a Ruby library for extracting information from a webpage and
converting it into an Atom feed.

## Rationale

Feeds are great. But sometimes a website doesn't provide a feed or doesn't
provide a feed for the specific content that you want. That's where Feedstock
can help.

Feedstock is a Ruby library that you can use to create an Atom feed. It takes a
URL to the webpage to check and a hash of rules. The rules tell Feedstock how to
extract and transform the data it finds on the webpage.

## Installation

Feedstock is available as a gem:

```shell
$ gem install feedstock
```
